  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: We compared the proteomic signatures of the
               hippocampal lesion induced in three different animal models of
               mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis
               (MTLE+HS): the systemic pilocarpine model (PILO), the
               intracerebroventricular kainic acid model (KA), and the
               perforant pathway stimulation model (PPS). METHODS: We used
               shotgun proteomics to analyze the proteomes and find enriched
               biological pathways of the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus (DG)
               isolated from the hippocampi of the three animal models. We also
               compared the proteomes obtained in the animal models to that
               from the DG of patients with pharmacoresistant MTLE+HS. RESULTS:
               We found that each animal model presents specific profiles of
               proteomic changes. The PILO model showed responses predominantly
               related to neuronal excitatory imbalance. The KA model revealed
               alterations mainly in synaptic activity. The PPS model displayed
               abnormalities in metabolism and oxidative stress. We also
               identified common biological pathways enriched in all three
               models, such as inflammation and immune response, which were
               also observed in tissue from patients. However, none of the
               models could recapitulate the profile of molecular changes
               observed in tissue from patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results
               indicate that each model has its own set of biological responses
               leading to epilepsy. Thus, it seems that only using a
               combination of the three models may one replicate more closely
               the mechanisms underlying MTLE+HS as seen in patients.",

  abstract  = "Depression is a complex and multifactorial disease, affecting
               about 6.5\% of the elderly population in what is referred to as
               late-life depression (LLD). Despite its public health relevance,
               there is still limited information about the molecular
               mechanisms of LLD. We analyzed the blood plasma of 50 older
               adults, 19 with LLD and 31 controls, through untargeted mass
               spectrometry, and used systems biology tools to identify
               biochemical pathways and biological processes dysregulated in
               the disease. We found 96 differentially expressed proteins
               between LLD patients and control individuals. Using elastic-net
               regression, we generated a panel of 75 proteins that comprises a
               potential model for determining the molecular signature of LLD.
               We also showed that biological pathways related to
               vesicle-mediated transport and voltage-dependent calcium
               channels may be dysregulated in LLD. These data can help to
               build an understanding of the molecular basis of LLD, offering
               an integrated view of the biomolecular alterations that occur in
               this disorder. SIGNIFICANCE: Major depressive disorder in the
               elderly, called late-life depression (LLD), is a common and
               disabling disorder, with recent prevalence estimates of 6.5\% in
               the general population. Despite the public health relevance,
               there is still limited information about the molecular
               mechanisms of LLD. The findings in this paper shed light on LLD
               heterogeneous biological mechanisms. We uncovered a potential
               novel biomolecular signature for LLD and biological pathways
               related to this condition which can be targets for the
               development of novel interventions for prevention, early
               diagnosis, and treatment of LLD.",
