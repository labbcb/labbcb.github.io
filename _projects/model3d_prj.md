The objective of the National Institute of Science and Technology in Modeling of Complex Human Diseases with 3D Platforms (INCT-Model3D) is to create and enhance 3D models for chronic non-communicable diseases, allowing for the understanding of the mechanisms associated with them and promoting the development of precise and personalized therapeutic strategies. The group has expertise in the construction of organoids, as well as in the development of materials such as biopolymers, 3D bioprinting, and microfluidics with organ-on-a-chip models, increasing the possibilities of generating more complex in vitro models for the approach to chronic diseases. These technologies generate products with high commercial value and market transfer potential, supporting more effective treatments that increase patient survival and quality of life, and bring savings to the healthcare system.
