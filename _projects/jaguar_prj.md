It is increasingly known that not all people respond the same way after treatment. The differences are explained by different lifestyles in countries and the genetic characteristics of their populations.

Immunogenomic studies in the Latin American population will help generate specific health proposals for our population and guide personalized medicine.

The project is known as Project JAGUAR (Joining All: Genes, immUnity And diveRsity), named after the jaguar, a native animal of Latin America. The project is part of the Ancestry Networks for the Human Cell Atlas of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and is supported by the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

The immune system is made up of many different types of cells that interact with each other to provide an immune response, which combats various disease-causing organisms. In some cases, the immune system mistakenly starts attacking healthy cells and tissues, which is known as an autoimmune disease.
